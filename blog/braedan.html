							<h2>Braedan Cwilewicz

						<p>
							Braedan Cwilewicz is a 5 year software developer, working with small groups on game development and coding in C. He is self taught and has a lot of experience with the nitty gritty details of computers and the technology sector. Being self taught, he spoke a lot of the importance of knowing the basics and working up from there, as well as how to work with others in a team. He provided a lot of insight to teaching and helping others understand, as he helps lots of others and I have gone to him in the past when I needed assistance. He knows the importance of understanding and teaching others and was able to give me a few ideas and things to keep in mind as I move forward with this.
