							<h2>Jamhacks</h2>
							<h4>May 22, 2021</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							JamhacksV is a hackathon that me and Jahangir decided to participate in together. We created a prototype of a software/hardware project while connecting with the community in a weeklong hackathon. This program is a technology 'hackathon' that is run by students at SJAM, designed to encourage youth into computer science, coding, and software. Me and Janik worked with the community in helping the group of over 200 people throughout the weekend of the program to both learn and share our knowledge. 
							<br><br>
							In addition to connecting with others in the technology community throughout the weekend, we also created a hardware and software project / prototype for cat owners, to help with feeding their cats. This was a lot of fun because it combined our connecting with creating a prototype of a product that could be useful to many other people with our skills. We have an outline of our project linked

							<br><br>
							This is a bit of a shorter blog but it was super fun, productive and also ties into what I am working toward. Thanks!
