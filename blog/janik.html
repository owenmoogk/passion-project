							<h2>Jahangir Abdullayev

							<h4>May 1, 2021</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							Jahangir Abdullayev is a technology enthusiast who has had 6 years of experience in the sector of coding and web development. He also is very familiar with CAD and technology in general. I started talking with him about what he has been doing, including designing a robotic dog and building websites from scratch. He has always been passionate about teaching and helping others in the community, being part of a Robotics Team and participating in outreach to disadvantaged communities. He is employed at Engineering Science Quest at the University of Waterloo, where he teaches younger students about technology. He provided me with lots of ideas and insight on how to go forward, as well as teaching me about some things to keep in mind when working with kids. He talked about how kids don't want to work to learn and the importance of making the education environment fun. He also talked about some of his tactics, like taking something they are passionate about and then turning it into something educational. He also told me about some of the things he did when he started learning, and how it was so important to have free reign, so he could discover the amazing things that technology can do. He also touched on the computer programming club that he was in, how seeing what those older than him did and how it inspired him to keep learning, as he wanted to reach the level that they were on and create similar results.
