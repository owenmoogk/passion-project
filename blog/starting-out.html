							<h2>Starting out</h2>
							<h4>April 27, 2021</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							My initial response to the passion project was a bit of confusion and thought, as I wasn't
							sure how I was to pursue something with everything going on in the world at the moment.
							After thinking a bit more I came up with some ideas...and now I am quite excited to get
							started. Choosing somewhere to start was quite easy for me, as I have a very large interest
							in technology and I have also been learning and working a lot to develop skills in the area
							over the last year. The difficult part was thinking of a medium to do this, and I am still
							not quite sure, as a lot of options that would have been available previously are not
							anymore.

							<br><br>

							Some things I've looked into are working with <a href="https://janik.codes"
								style="color: black">Janik Abdullayev</a> from the Bluevale CI coding club. He has done
							a lot of great things with starting and teaching, as well as working with other students
							from the school to learn and solve problems. I think this would be a great oppertunity to
							offer my skills and help out.

							Something else that I was thinking of, in a different domain would be to help some small
							organization to simply build and deploy a website, or work on something of the sorts.

							Lastly, I also was looking into some organizations like <a href="https://communitech.ca"
								style="color: black">Communitech</a> and
							<a href="https://jamhacks.ca/" style="color: black">Jamhacks</a> who are also helping the
							community in different ways, and I am planning on digging deeper into
							working with them.

							<br><br>

							I am excited to get started and see where this leads me, but I am a bit nervous as I don't
							like trying new things, and I have never done anything like this before. As for my vision, I
							hope that whatever I end up doing brings positivity to others, and others gain something
							from my final output. Can't wait to get started!
