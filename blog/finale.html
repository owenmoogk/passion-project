						<p>
							I guess this is it... I learned a lot and this was really fun to pursue in all the different forms that it took. This is a bit of a shorter blog, just wrapping up some loose ends as well as some reflections.
							<br><br>
							First off, this was awesome. I did a lot of different things through the last month, including teaching technology and coding to a kindergarten class, connecting to the community through a hackathon, assisting others with technology online, and lastly making a cool AI system in collaboration with Austin's project. Everything was different, but all of them helped the community with technology, which was my main goal.
							<br><br>
							Going forward...? I plan to continue doing cool things with technology, as that truly is a passion of mine, as it always has been. Not just for this project. As for connecting with the community? It was a lot of fun, but I don't think I am going to go out of my way to continue doing it. However if opportunities come up it will definitely take them, because although it is a lot of work it is quite rewarding. Thanks for following along with me on this journey! I guess thats it.
							<br><br>
							Peace!
