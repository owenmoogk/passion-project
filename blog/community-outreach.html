							<h2>Community Outreach</h2>
							<h4>April 29, 2021</h4>

						<p>
							I just wanted to quickly touch on something I've been doing over the past few months that relates to my passion project.
							Across online forums I have assisted and impacted ~300 people looking for assistance with technology, on a platform called 
							<a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.
							It is designed for software developers to connect with eachother and help with questions. I have been a member of their community for about a year and a half (since I started coding), but now due to my learning about new topics over the recent lockdowns I have taken on a goal of helping others as others helped me when I was learning, and I am answering and teaching about topics that others in the community are interested in.
							<br><br>
							I actually started this before my passion project began, but I now am taking it much more seriously as I realize how important it is to use my knowledge to help others, and not just use it for myself. Not only is this good for the community but I find it very rewarding for myself, as people are very thankful and glad to be able to continue working on their endeavours with new knowledge.
							<br><br>
							Just a short update on what I have been doing, but I will be continuing to do this as it isn't too difficult and adds a lot to the community.
							Peace!
