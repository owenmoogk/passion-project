							<h2>C2L Blogs</h2>

						<p>
							I just recently looked at a few of the other Choose to Leaders blogs, and I thought they were super interesting! The first one I looked at was Austin Wang's blog. His topic is quite different to mine, but I think he is doing a really cool job documenting some things in nature that are in plain sight, but nobody really stops to think about. He is taking pictures and writing about different animals that he sees, and then submitting them to national geographic as part of a much larger project. This really intrigued me, and I even briefly worked with him to combine my knowledge of software with his project, and I wrote some code to allow him to setup a camera that would recognize different animals and take pictures and automatically log them. This was a fun collaboration, and although I don't think he ended up using it, it was a cool proof of concept and idea.

							Another blog that I have looked at was Mike's. Mikes mental minute is pretty interesting, and I think that it is awesome that he raised over six thousand dollars. I think mental health is super important and I think Mike is doing a great job of capturing this in his website, blog, and fundraiser. I really like how he has lots of statistics to back up everything he is talking about, and he is making a difference which is amazing. His website looks great and it seems like he has done a lot of connection with others in the community, and I think thats super inspiring.
							<br><br>
							Lastly, I had a look at Gen's website, and I thought that it was really interesting how she is bringing people together with a collaborative cookbook. Her website is very well designed and I think it is an awesome idea that I would have never thought of. Gen's always doing crazy cool things from starting her own business, participating in LITERALLY everything, and now this. I think cooking is a great way to relax as well as getting things done, and is something thats really fun to learn.
